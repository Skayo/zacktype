# zacktype

## Goals of this project

- [ ] Measure typing speed with a simple test
- [ ] Minimalistic front end (no framework)
- [ ] Have most of the game logic in its own class, separate from the front end, so writing unit tests is much simpler (only expose some stores)

## TODO

- [ ] Be able to actually play the game, which means:
  - [ ] Calculate and display CPS
  - [ ] Implemented a "game over" state
  - [ ] Be able to reset the game and play again
  - [ ] Count errors
  - [X] Handle user input
  - [X] Handle backspace
- [ ] Design a minimalistic front end
  - [ ] Mockup
  - [ ] Website
- [ ] Calculate and display accuracy
- [ ] Calculate and display WPM
- [ ] More unit tests
- [ ] Maybe make a light and dark theme?
- [ ] Maybe add some settings?
- [ ] Maybe use quotes instead of random text?
